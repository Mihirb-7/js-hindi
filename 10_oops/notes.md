# js and classes

--> earlier in js classes is not there and technically nowadays also classes is not there it is a prototype based lang (is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects that serve as prototypes)

## OOPS 
-- programming structure

## objects 
-- collecton of properties (variable and constants)  and methods
--toLowerCase eg

## parts of oops
Object literal -- it simply means literal of objects and nothing else   ( is a data type used to define objects in JavaScript)


--constructor fn
--Prototypes
--Classes
--Instances (new , this)


## 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encaptulation
Inheritnce
Polymorphism
